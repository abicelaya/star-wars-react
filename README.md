# React Star Wars Web

### In this project, I developed a web application that consumes data from an API to display information about Star Wars starships. The application allows users to view a list of starships and access detailed information about each starship.

## What I did:

- API Consumption: I used an API to retrieve and display data about various starships from the Star Wars universe.
- Starship List: I implemented a view that shows a list of starships, including basic information such as name, model, and manufacturer.
- Item Details: By selecting a starship from the list, users can view a detail page with comprehensive information about the selected starship.

## Technologies and Skills Applied:

- POSTMAN: I used it to test and verify API calls.
- Route Guards: I implemented route protection to ensure that only authenticated users can access the starship list.
- Routing in React: I set up navigation between the starship list and detail pages.
- Context: I used Context API to manage user authentication state throughout the application.
- Firebase: I integrated Firebase to handle user authentication and control access to protected routes.

The result is an interactive application that offers users an immersive experience in the Star Wars universe, displaying both an overview of the starships and specific details about each one.
